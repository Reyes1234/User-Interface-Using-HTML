   <h1>WHY DINOSAURS ARE COOLER THAN YOU</h1>

   <body>
     Most dinosaurs are best-known by their genus, rather than by their species name. For example, most people would talk about the Iguanodon, which is actually a genus, rather than an individual species of Iguanodon.

It’s only paleontologists (and other clever people) who would talk about Iguanodon bernissartensis, which is an individual species of Iguanodon.

In fact, most people have only heard about one species of dinosaur – the Tyrannosaurus Rex, which is a species of Tyrannosaurus. All of the other famous dinosaur names, such as Spinosaurus, Allosaurus and Velociraptor, are genera.
