# User Interface Using HTML
Part 1.
Save file as Reyes_Assignment6.HTML
using only HTMl create a page that includes: a big header, a paragraph of text
in a readale size, a link on one of the words in the paragraph that opens
its destination in a new tab, an image,a bullet list with a numbered list inside
it, create three columns of text side by side (search "HTML Table"), place an
image on the page to the right of a block of text, finally, in smaller than
normal text, include a link that automatically opens an email message

Part 2.
Create an HTML calculator, add JQuery and several number and operator buttons to
a new HTML page
Use a script block to add JQuery click events to each of the buttons
make each button add its value to a string, then when the "=" button is pressed,
evaluate the expression with "eval(my_equation_string)" and report the result
Experiment to see how many, or few, event handlers you actually numbered
jQuery can add handlers to groups of elements based on their CSS class, and
not just by their DOM ID
